# Web-Scraping-NLP-Analysis-
During my time working on projects, I developed a Log Analyzer, a Python-based system, to simulate and analyze web application logs. The primary goal was to understand user activity on a web application. The project consisted of three main steps:

    Log Generation: I simulated a web application with three potential pages a user could visit: homepage, about page, and contact page. Each visit by a user generated a log entry containing the timestamp, user ID, and the page they visited.
    Storing Logs: Every generated log was stored in a text file with a timestamp to simulate real-time logging.
    Analysis: After generating the logs, the system analyzes them to determine the most frequently visited page.

When executed, the program generates 1000 logs and then provides an analysis of which page was the most visited, offering insights into user behavior.
